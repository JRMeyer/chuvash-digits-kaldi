there are a lot of tuning experiments here.

ones to look at right now:
  2y is a TDNN baseline
  4f is a good jesus-layer system
  4q is an improved TDNN with various bells and whistles from Vijay.
  4r is a slightly-better jesus-layer system than 4f, with one more layer.
  5d is probably the best performance so far on average, but we should
      try reducing --xent-regularize from 0.2 to 0.1.
