Dan and Nikolay said on kaldi-help that the monophones are indeed
trained with delta+delta-deltas, so align_deltas.sh is a deceptive
name, and it really should be align_triphones.sh

So the typical workflow for a run GMM script trains monophones from
a flat start, then uses the alignments from that model to:

(1) create a decision tree to decide what should be the triphones
    we use out of the n^3 possible triphones
    
(2) start training the new triphone model

Then what usually happens in the run scripts is that this triphone
model + alignments get used to train a new triphone model with some
kind of transformation (LDA/MLLT/fMLLR/etc) or SAT.

Where I was getting confused is that the original triphone model (tri1)
is used not only to train these other models with some adaptation training,
but tri1 is also used to train a new triphone model with the exact same
features (tri2a). This is in ways redundant, going off of what Dan and
Nikolay said. I think it was just added for comparability between different
final triphone acoustic models. That is we go:


                  --> tri2a (just normal mfccs like tri1)
                 /         
mono0 --> tri1 --
                 \
                  --> tri2b (with some lda mllt adapataion)


So now, tri2a and tri2b are more comparable, than say, tri2b and tri1.
Because tri1 and tri2a are similar but not exactly the same because the
decision tree gets re-made, so there can be more or less senomes in tri2a
after its retrained.
